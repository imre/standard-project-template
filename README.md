# Urban Mobility Model

Modelling real-time traffic for smart cities.

## >> INITIAL SETUP FOR NEW PROJECTS <<   

When you create a new project, we recommend that you do the following additional manual steps (and then delete this section of the readme).

- Add project details to this Readme!  
- Go to **Settings → Code security and Analysis** and enable “Dependabot Version Updates.” This will automatically create Pull Requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date. To activate this feature, you will need to specify the package ecosystem (e.g. NPM) and save the YML file.  
- Add a brief description of the project to the **About** section (top right of this page). If your project involves a website, then add the URL here too.

### Main Branch

Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. It should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch

Should be considered fragile; code should compile and run, but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches

A branch per feature that is being worked on. See: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
